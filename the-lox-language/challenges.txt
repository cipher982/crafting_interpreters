This informal introduction leaves a lot unspecified.
List several open questions you have about the Lox languageâ€™s syntax and semantics.
What do you think the answers should be?

- can i specify types at all like python?
- dictionaries, lists?
- importing modules?

Lox is a pretty tiny language.
What features do you think it is missing that would make it annoying to use for real programs?
(Aside from the standard library, of course.)

- error handling?
- concurrency support?
